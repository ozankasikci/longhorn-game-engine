## Phase Overview
High-impact architectural improvements to strengthen the engine's core foundation by eliminating code duplication, expanding mathematical utilities, and adding essential resource and event management abstractions.

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 10.1**: Remove Transform Duplication (30 minutes)
- **Phase 10.2**: Expand Engine-Math-Core (45 minutes)  
- **Phase 10.3**: Create Engine-Resource-Core (60 minutes)
- **Phase 10.4**: Add Engine-Events-Core (45 minutes)
- **Total Estimated Time**: 3 hours

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 10.1: Remove Transform Duplication ⏳ READY
**Objective**: Eliminate Transform duplication between engine-components-core and engine-scene-core

#### Task 10.1.1: Analyze Transform Implementations ⏳
*Status: Ready to Start*
*Estimated Time: 10 minutes*
**Current State**: Two Transform implementations identified:
- `/crates/core/engine-components-core/src/lib.rs` - Simple f32 array implementation
- `/crates/core/engine-scene-core/src/transform.rs` - Advanced glam-based implementation

**Implementation Plan**:
- Compare both Transform implementations in detail
- Evaluate pros/cons of each approach (simplicity vs. functionality)
- Analyze current usage patterns in editor and ECS systems
- Decide which implementation to keep as the standard
- Document rationale for decision

#### Task 10.1.2: Consolidate Transform Implementation ⏳
*Status: Pending*
*Estimated Time: 20 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:
- Remove duplicate Transform from selected crate
- Update all imports across the codebase
- Ensure ECS Component trait implementations remain intact
- Update any dependent code to use consolidated Transform
- Verify editor compilation and scene navigation functionality
- Update relevant tests

### Phase 10.2: Expand Engine-Math-Core ⏳ PENDING
**Objective**: Create comprehensive mathematical foundation for the engine

- Plan resource dependency tracking and reference counting
- Document resource lifecycle management approach
- Design integration points with future asset loading systems

#### Task 10.3.2: Implement Resource Core Abstractions ⏳
*Status: Pending*
*Estimated Time: 40 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:
- Create new crate `crates/core/engine-resource-core/`

- Create ResourceState and ResourceMetadata types
- Implement ResourceManager and ResourceCache trait definitions
- Add resource dependency tracking mechanisms
- Create ResourceLoader trait for extensible loading
- Add to workspace configuration and dependencies

### Phase 10.4: Add Engine-Events-Core ⏳ PENDING
**Objective**: Create event system foundation for input and game events

#### Task 10.4.1: Design Event System Architecture ⏳
*Status: Pending*
*Estimated Time: 15 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:

- Design integration with input systems and game logic

#### Task 10.4.2: Implement Event Core System ⏳
*Status: Pending*
*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:
- Create new crate `crates/core/engine-events-core/`
- Implement Event trait and common event types
