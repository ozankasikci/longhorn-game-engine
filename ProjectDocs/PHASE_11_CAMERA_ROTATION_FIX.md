# Phase 11: Camera Rotation Fix

## Status: Completed
**Date:** January 2025

## Problem
Camera rotation wasn't working in the Scene View when using right-click + drag. The issue was that mouse events were being intercepted by the `egui_dock::DockArea` before reaching the Scene View panel.

## Investigation
1. **Initial Issue**: Right-click + drag wasn't rotating the camera in the Scene View
2. **Root Cause**: The egui_dock TabViewer was consuming mouse events before they reached the Scene View
3. **Debugging Steps**:
   - Added extensive debug logging to track mouse input detection
   - Discovered that `response.dragged()` and `response.secondary_clicked()` weren't being triggered
   - Found that pointer deltas were always zero when using standard response methods

## Solution
1. **Interactive Response**: Used `ui.interact()` to create a proper interactive area that captures mouse events:
   ```rust
   // Main view area - allocate space first
   let available_size = ui.available_size();
   let (rect, mut response) = ui.allocate_exact_size(available_size, egui::Sense::click_and_drag());
   
   // CRITICAL: Create an interactive area that captures mouse events
   // This ensures the scene view gets mouse input even in a docked panel
   response = ui.interact(rect, response.id, egui::Sense::click_and_drag());
   ```

2. **Response-based Navigation**: Updated navigation code to use response's drag detection methods:
   ```rust
   // Use the response object's drag detection for reliable input in docked panels
   let is_dragging = response.dragged_by(egui::PointerButton::Secondary);
   let drag_started = response.drag_started_by(egui::PointerButton::Secondary);
   let drag_stopped = response.drag_stopped_by(egui::PointerButton::Secondary);
   ```

3. **Manual Delta Calculation**: Implemented manual mouse delta calculation as a fallback:
   ```rust
   // Calculate mouse delta using multiple methods
   if let Some(current_pos) = pointer_pos {
       let effective_delta = if let Some(last_pos) = scene_navigation.last_mouse_pos {
           // Always calculate manual delta
           let manual_delta = egui::Vec2::new(
               current_pos.x - last_pos.x,
               current_pos.y - last_pos.y
           );
           
           // Use manual delta if there's any movement
           if manual_delta.length() > 0.01 {
               manual_delta
           } else {
               egui::Vec2::ZERO
           }
       } else {
           egui::Vec2::ZERO
       };
   ```

## Files Modified
1. `/crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/scene_view/mod.rs`
   - Added `ui.interact()` call to ensure proper mouse event capture
   - Removed redundant raw input checking

2. `/crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/scene_view/navigation.rs`
   - Updated to use response-based drag detection
   - Simplified mouse delta calculation
   - Removed excessive debug logging

3. `/crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/scene_view/scene_view_impl.rs`
   - Removed debug rendering logs that were cluttering the view

## Key Learnings
1. **egui_dock Event Handling**: Docked panels need special handling to receive mouse events properly
2. **ui.interact() is Critical**: Creating an interactive response ensures the widget gets input priority
3. **Response Methods are Reliable**: Using `response.dragged_by()` is more reliable than checking raw input
4. **Manual Delta Calculation**: Sometimes needed as a fallback when pointer deltas aren't available

## Result
Camera rotation now works correctly with right-click + drag in the Scene View, even when docked in the egui_dock layout.
