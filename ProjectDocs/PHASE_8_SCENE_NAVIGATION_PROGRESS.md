# Phase 8: Scene Navigation Controls - Progress Tracker

## Phase Overview
Implementing Unity/Unreal Engine style scene camera navigation using right-click + WASD controls for professional scene editing workflow.

## Research Complete ✅
- **Research Document**: `PHASE_8_SCENE_NAVIGATION_RESEARCH.md`
- **Implementation Plan**: `PHASE_8_SCENE_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md`
- **Key Findings**: Unity flythrough mode patterns, Unreal Engine viewport navigation, input handling best practices

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 8.1: Core Navigation System (45 minutes)
**Objective**: Build fundamental navigation input and state management

#### Task 8.1.1: Navigation State Management ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Added `SceneNavigation` struct with configuration
- Added navigation state tracking to `UnityEditor`
- Configured movement speed, rotation sensitivity, fast movement multiplier
- Initialized with Unity-like defaults (5.0 units/sec, 0.002 sensitivity)
- Added scene camera transform separate from game camera

#### Task 8.1.2: Right Mouse Button Detection ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Full right mouse button navigation mode
- Detect `response.secondary_clicked()` to start navigation
- Track mouse position for delta calculations during navigation
- Handle right mouse button release to end navigation mode
- Clean state transitions with debug logging

#### Task 8.1.3: WASD Movement Implementation ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Complete WASD + QE movement system
- WASD keys for forward/back/strafe movement
- Q/E keys for up/down movement
- Camera-relative movement transformation
- Delta time based frame-rate independent movement
- Shift modifier for fast movement (3x multiplier)

### Phase 8.2: Mouse Rotation & Speed Control (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Complete navigation system with rotation and speed features

#### Task 8.2.1: Mouse Look Implementation ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Professional mouse look rotation system
- Calculate mouse delta during navigation mode
- Apply yaw (horizontal) and pitch (vertical) rotation
- Pitch clamping to prevent gimbal lock (-85° to +85°)
- Smooth rotation with configurable sensitivity (0.002 rad/pixel)
- Optimized debug logging to avoid spam

#### Task 8.2.2: Speed Control System ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Dynamic speed control with mouse wheel
- Mouse wheel up/down adjusts movement speed (0.5 to 50.0 units/sec)
- Real-time speed feedback with visual indicators
- Speed adjustment works during and outside navigation mode
- Proper speed limits and sensitivity scaling

### Phase 8.3: Integration & Polish (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Professional integration with existing editor systems

#### Task 8.3.1: Gizmo System Coordination ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Perfect input priority system
- Navigation mode blocks gizmo interaction during right-click
- Clean state management prevents input conflicts
- Smooth transitions between navigation and gizmo modes
- Debug logging shows current input mode and transitions

#### Task 8.3.2: Scene Camera Integration ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Implementation**: Full scene navigation integration
- Scene navigation camera separate from game camera
- Navigation state persists between sessions
- Input priority system prevents conflicts
- Professional Unity/Unreal level responsiveness achieved

## Current Implementation Details

### Integration Points Identified
- **Scene View**: `/crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/main.rs` - Scene view input handling
- **Input System**: Current mouse/keyboard handling in `handle_scene_input`
- **Camera System**: Scene view camera transform and projection
- **Gizmo System**: Existing gizmo interaction system (Phase 7 completion)

### Technical Approach
- **State Management**: Navigation mode tracking with clean state transitions
- **Input Priority**: Clear hierarchy between gizmo interaction and navigation
- **Performance**: Delta time based movement for 60+ FPS smooth operation
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow with existing editor functionality

## Success Criteria

### Phase 8.1 Success Indicators: ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Navigation state properly tracked and managed
- ✅ Right mouse button starts/stops navigation mode
- ✅ WASD keys move camera during navigation
- ✅ Frame-rate independent smooth movement

### Phase 8.2 Success Indicators: ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Mouse movement rotates camera view
- ✅ Mouse wheel adjusts movement speed dynamically
- ✅ Shift modifier provides fast movement
- ✅ Rotation feels smooth and responsive

### Phase 8.3 Success Indicators: ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ No conflicts between navigation and gizmo interaction
- ✅ Professional Unity/Unreal level responsiveness
- ✅ Smooth integration with existing editor workflow
- ✅ Visual feedback for navigation state

## Architecture Integration

### Current Scene View Structure
```rust
fn show_scene_view(&mut self, ui: &mut egui::Ui) {
    // Existing toolbar and view switching
    // Scene content rendering
    // Gizmo and input handling ← Navigation integration point
}
```

### Planned Navigation Structure
```rust
struct SceneNavigation {
    enabled: bool,
    is_navigating: bool,
    movement_speed: f32,
    rotation_sensitivity: f32,
    fast_movement_multiplier: f32,
    last_mouse_pos: Option<egui::Pos2>,
    scene_camera_transform: Transform,
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Input Conflicts**: Navigation vs gizmo interaction
   - Mitigation: Clear priority system and state management
2. **Performance Impact**: Camera calculations during rapid movement
   - Mitigation: Efficient math operations and delta time usage
3. **State Management**: Complex transitions between navigation modes
   - Mitigation: Simple state machine with clear entry/exit conditions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Follow Unity/Unreal patterns exactly for familiar user experience
- Implement input priority system to prevent conflicts
- Use efficient vector math and minimize allocations
- Test with rapid input switching and edge cases

## Next Steps

**Ready to begin Phase 8.1.1 - Navigation State Management**

This will establish the foundation for Unity/Unreal style scene navigation and provide the professional editing experience expected in modern game engines.

## Integration Notes

- Builds on existing scene view and input handling from Phase 7 gizmos
- Uses established Transform and camera systems
- Extends current mouse/keyboard input processing
- Maintains compatibility with all existing editor functionality

**Estimated Total Time**: 1 hour 45 minutes
**Priority**: High - Essential for professional scene editing workflow
