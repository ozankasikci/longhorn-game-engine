# Phase 22: Project View Enhancements Plan

## Overview
Enhance the project view with comprehensive folder management capabilities to provide a professional asset organization experience similar to modern game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.

## Goals
- Enable users to create, rename, and delete folders in the project view
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving assets between folders
- Provide intuitive context menus for folder operations
- Maintain proper asset reference integrity during folder operations
- Implement undo/redo support for folder operations

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Project View Components
- **Location**: `crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/project_view.rs`
- **Current Features**:
  - Basic file listing and display
  - Asset thumbnail generation
  - File type filtering
  - Basic navigation

### Missing Features
- Folder creation/deletion
- Asset moving between folders
- Context menu operations
- Drag and drop support
- Folder renaming
- Undo/redo for folder operations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 22.1: Core Folder Operations
**Duration**: 3-4 days

#### Tasks:
1. **Folder Creation**
   - Add "New Folder" button to project view toolbar
   - Implement folder creation dialog with validation
   - Update project view to refresh after folder creation

2. **Folder Deletion**
   - Add delete confirmation dialog
   - Implement recursive folder deletion with safety checks
   - Handle asset reference cleanup

3. **Folder Renaming**
   - Add inline editing for folder names
   - Implement rename validation (no duplicates, valid characters)
   - Update asset paths after rename

#### Technical Details:
- Extend `ProjectViewPanel` with folder operation methods
- Add folder management utilities to asset system
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### Phase 22.2: Context Menu System
**Duration**: 2-3 days

#### Tasks:
1. **Context Menu Framework**
   - Implement right-click context menu system
   - Add context-sensitive menu items based on selection

2. **Folder Context Menu**
   - "New Folder" option
   - "Rename" option
   - "Delete" option
   - "Open in File Explorer" option

3. **Asset Context Menu**
   - "Cut/Copy/Paste" operations
   - "Delete" option
   - "Rename" option
   - "Show in File Explorer" option

### Phase 22.3: Drag and Drop System
**Duration**: 4-5 days

#### Tasks:
1. **Drag and Drop Framework**
   - Implement egui drag and drop for project view
   - Add visual feedback during drag operations
   - Handle drop validation

2. **Asset Moving**
   - Enable dragging assets between folders
   - Update asset paths and references
   - Provide visual feedback for valid drop zones

3. **Folder Moving**
   - Enable dragging folders to reorganize hierarchy
   - Prevent invalid operations (dropping folder into itself)
   - Update all contained asset paths

### Phase 22.4: Advanced Features
**Duration**: 3-4 days

#### Tasks:
1. **Multi-Selection Support**
   - Enable selecting multiple assets/folders
   - Batch operations for selected items
   - Visual feedback for multi-selection

2. **Undo/Redo System**
   - Implement command pattern for folder operations
   - Add undo/redo stack management
   - Integrate with existing editor undo system

3. **Search and Filtering**
   - Add search bar to project view
   - Implement folder-based filtering
   - Add quick navigation shortcuts

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structures
```rust
pub struct FolderOperation {
    pub operation_type: FolderOperationType,
    pub source_path: PathBuf,
    pub target_path: Option<PathBuf>,
    pub affected_assets: Vec<AssetId>,
}

pub enum FolderOperationType {
    Create,
    Delete,
    Rename,
    Move,
}
```

### Key Components
1. **FolderManager**: Core folder operations logic
2. **ProjectViewDragDrop**: Drag and drop handling
3. **ProjectViewContextMenu**: Context menu system
4. **FolderOperationHistory**: Undo/redo support

## File Modifications Required

### New Files:
- `crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/project_view/folder_manager.rs`
- `crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/project_view/drag_drop.rs`
- `crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/project_view/context_menu.rs`

### Modified Files:
- `crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/project_view.rs`
- `crates/core/engine-resource-core/src/asset_manager.rs`
- `crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/mod.rs`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Folder creation/deletion logic
- Path validation and sanitization
- Asset reference updating

### Integration Tests:
- Full folder operation workflows
- Drag and drop scenarios
- Undo/redo functionality

### Manual Testing:
- UI responsiveness during operations
- Visual feedback quality
- Error handling and user messaging

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Users can create new folders with valid names
- [ ] Users can delete folders with confirmation
- [ ] Users can rename folders with validation
- [ ] Users can drag and drop assets between folders
- [ ] Users can drag and drop folders to reorganize
- [ ] Context menus provide relevant operations
- [ ] Multi-selection works for batch operations
- [ ] Undo/redo works for all folder operations

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Operations complete within 200ms for small folders
- [ ] UI remains responsive during operations
- [ ] No asset reference corruption during moves
- [ ] Proper error messages for invalid operations
- [ ] Consistent UI behavior with rest of editor

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Asset Reference Corruption
**Mitigation**: Implement atomic operations with rollback capability

### Risk: Performance Issues with Large Folders
**Mitigation**: Implement progressive loading and virtual scrolling

### Risk: Complex Drag and Drop Edge Cases
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback

## Dependencies
- egui drag and drop support
- File system operations
- Asset reference tracking system
- Editor undo/redo framework

## Future Enhancements
- Folder templates and presets
- Asset tags and labels
- Advanced search with filters
- Folder watching for external changes
- Cloud storage integration
