# Phase 11.3: Professional Free Look Camera

## Status: Completed
**Date:** January 2025

## Problem
After implementing orbit rotation, the user pointed out that the camera was moving in circles/ellipses when they expected it to just look left/right. The issue was that orbit rotation moves the camera position around a pivot point, but industry-standard right-click + drag actually implements "free look" - the camera stays in place and only rotates its view.

## industry-standard Scene View Controls
- **Right-click + drag**: Free look (FPS-style camera rotation)
- **Alt + Left-click + drag**: Orbit around pivot point
- **Middle-click + drag**: Pan camera laterally

## Solution
Reverted to simple free-look rotation:

```rust
/// Apply mouse look rotation to the camera - professional free look (FPS-style)
pub fn apply_mouse_look(scene_nav: &mut SceneNavigation, mouse_delta: egui::Vec2) -> Vec<ConsoleMessage> {
  // Calculate rotation deltas (free look - just rotate the camera view)
  let pitch_delta = -mouse_delta.y * scene_nav.rotation_sensitivity;
  let yaw_delta = -mouse_delta.x * scene_nav.rotation_sensitivity;
  
  // Update camera rotation directly (FPS-style look around)
  scene_nav.scene_camera_transform.rotation[0] += pitch_delta;
  scene_nav.scene_camera_transform.rotation[1] += yaw_delta;
  
  // Clamp pitch to prevent camera flipping
  scene_nav.scene_camera_transform.rotation[0] = scene_nav.scene_camera_transform.rotation[0]
    .clamp(-1.5, 1.5); // ~85 degrees
}
```

## Key Differences
1. **Free Look**: Camera position stays fixed, only rotation changes
2. **Orbit**: Camera position moves around a pivot (removed for now)
3. **WASD Movement**: Still works with camera rotation for directional movement

## Files Modified
1. `/crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/scene_view/navigation.rs`
  - Changed from orbit rotation back to free-look rotation
  - Removed pivot calculations and position updates
  - Kept only rotation updates

## Result
Camera now behaves exactly like industry-standard Scene View free look:
- Right-click + drag rotates the view without moving the camera
- Horizontal movement = look left/right (yaw)
- Vertical movement = look up/down (pitch)
- Camera position remains stationary
- WASD moves in the direction you're looking

## Future Improvements
1. **Alt + Click Orbit**: Add orbit mode as a separate control
2. **Middle Mouse Pan**: Lateral camera movement
3. **Scroll Zoom**: Move camera forward/backward
4. **Focus (F)**: Center on selected object with smooth transition
