# Phase 27: Game Loop Architecture Refactoring

## Overview

This phase addresses the fundamental limitation of the Longhorn Game Engine: its heavy dependency on EGUI for the core game loop. Currently, the engine can only run games within the editor environment, lacking a proper standalone game runtime. This refactoring will implement a modern, professional game loop architecture based on industry best practices.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **EGUI Dependency**: The entire game loop runs through eframe/EGUI's event loop
2. **No Standalone Runtime**: Games can only run inside the editor, not as independent executables
3. **Limited Frame Control**: Frame timing, vsync, and update rates controlled by EGUI/eframe
4. **Coupled Input System**: All input processed through EGUI's event system
5. **No Proper Timestep Management**: Lacks fixed timestep for deterministic physics and interpolation for smooth rendering

### Current Architecture
- **Main Loop**: `LonghornEditor::update()` method called by eframe
- **Delta Time**: Managed by `EditorCoordinator` with basic clamping
- **Event Processing**: Entirely through EGUI's input system
- **Rendering**: Coupled with UI rendering pipeline
- **Game States**: Basic play/pause states within editor context

## Research Summary

### Industry Best Practices
Based on research of modern game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot, Bevy), the following patterns emerge:

#### 1. Fixed Timestep with Interpolation (Gold Standard)
- **Physics/Logic**: Fixed intervals (typically 60Hz) for deterministic behavior
- **Rendering**: Variable framerate with interpolation between physics states
- **Benefits**: Deterministic, network-friendly, smooth visuals, hardware-independent

#### 2. Accumulator Pattern
```rust
while accumulator >= fixed_timestep {
    previous_state = current_state;
    update_physics(current_state, fixed_timestep);
    accumulator -= fixed_timestep;
}
let alpha = accumulator / fixed_timestep;
render(interpolate(previous_state, current_state, alpha));
```

#### 3. Death Spiral Prevention
Cap maximum updates per frame to prevent infinite catch-up loops when performance drops.

### Rust-Specific Solutions
- **Winit Integration**: Platform-independent windowing and event handling
- **Available Crates**: `game-loop`, `pixel_loop` for reference implementations
- **ECS Integration**: Leverage existing ECS for system scheduling

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Game Loop Manager
```rust
pub struct GameLoop {
    fixed_timestep: Duration,
    accumulator: Duration,
    previous_time: Instant,
    max_updates_per_frame: u32,
}
```

#### 2. Application Trait
```rust
pub trait Application {
    fn initialize(&mut self, context: &mut GameContext);
    fn update(&mut self, context: &mut GameContext, delta_time: Duration);
    fn render(&mut self, context: &RenderContext, interpolation: f32);
    fn handle_event(&mut self, event: &GameEvent);
}
```

#### 3. System Scheduler
```rust
pub struct SystemScheduler {
    fixed_systems: Vec<Box<dyn System>>,     // Physics, logic
    variable_systems: Vec<Box<dyn System>>,  // Rendering, effects
}
```

#### 4. Game Context
```rust
pub struct GameContext {
    pub world: World,              // ECS World
    pub input: InputManager,       // Decoupled input system
    pub resources: ResourceManager, // Asset management
    pub time: TimeManager,         // Delta time, total time
}
```
