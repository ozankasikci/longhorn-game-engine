## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Architecture Approach ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Standalone renderer crate with texture-based egui integration 
**Rationale**: Solves paint callback issues, follows proven patterns from Bevy/rend3 
**Date**: 2024-12-13 

### 2. Technology Stack ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Direct WGPU 0.20, no abstraction layers 
**Rationale**: Simpler architecture, better performance, follows Bevy's successful approach 
**Date**: 2024-12-13 

### 3. Rendering Mode ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Retained-mode rendering with persistent GPU resources 
**Rationale**: Better performance, safer resource management, industry standard 
**Date**: 2024-12-13 

### 4. Integration Strategy ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Render to texture, display as egui image widget 
**Rationale**: Avoids paint callback execution issues, more reliable 
**Date**: 2024-12-13 

## Research Findings

### Major Insights
1. **Paint Callback Issues**: Root cause identified - egui-wgpu callback execution is unreliable
2. **Proven Patterns**: Bevy and rend3 use texture-based rendering successfully
3. **Performance**: Direct WGPU usage provides better performance than abstraction layers
4. **Architecture**: Separate renderer crate enables better testing and modularity

### Technical Requirements Identified
- WGPU 0.20 compatibility
- egui-wgpu integration for texture display
- Proper resource lifetime management
- Cross-platform shader support (WGSL)
- Thread-safe scene updates

## Risk Assessment

### üü¢ Low Risk
- **WGPU Compatibility**: Well-established API, good documentation
- **Texture Integration**: Proven pattern in egui ecosystem
- **Resource Management**: Standard RAII patterns apply

### üü° Medium Risk
- **Performance**: Need to validate 60 FPS target with 1000+ objects
- **Platform Support**: Need testing across different backends
- **Memory Usage**: GPU memory management needs careful design

### üî¥ High Risk
- **Integration Complexity**: Bridging ECS to renderer could be complex
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks is aggressive for full implementation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with triangle rendering to validate approach
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each sub-phase thoroughly before proceeding
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add profiling from day one
4. **Fallback Plan**: Keep existing renderer working during development

- Industry patterns (Bevy/rend3) provide proven architecture
- Texture-based approach is more reliable than callbacks
- Direct WGPU usage simplifies the architecture significantly

### Future Considerations
