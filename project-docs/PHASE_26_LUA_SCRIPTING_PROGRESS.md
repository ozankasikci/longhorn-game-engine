## API Design Status

### Component Access
```lua
-- Target API (not implemented)
local transform = entity:get_component("Transform")
transform.position = vec3(10, 0, 0)
```

### Event Handling
```lua
-- Target API (not implemented)
function script:on_collision(event)
    print("Hit:", event.other)
end
```

### World Queries
```lua
-- Target API (not implemented)
for entity, transform, velocity in world:query("Transform, Velocity") do
    -- Update logic
end
```

## Documentation Status
- [ ] API Reference (0%)
- [ ] Getting Started Guide (0%)
- [ ] Tutorial Series (0/5)
- [ ] Example Projects (0/3)
- [ ] Performance Guide (0%)

## Blockers & Risks
- None identified yet

## Next Steps
1. Set up mlua dependency in engine-scripting crate
2. Create basic LuaScriptEngine implementation
3. Design component marshaling approach

## Stakeholder Notes
Lua scripting will provide a lightweight, high-performance scripting solution with minimal overhead compared to alternatives like C#. The 4-week timeline is aggressive but achievable given the simpler integration requirements.

## Success Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Basic Lua runtime integrated
- [ ] ECS components accessible from Lua
- [ ] Hot-reload working reliably
- [ ] Full engine API exposed
- [ ] Editor integration complete
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Example games functional
