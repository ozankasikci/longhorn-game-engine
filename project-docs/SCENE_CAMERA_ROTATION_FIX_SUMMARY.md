# Scene Camera Rotation Fix Summary

## Issue
When right-clicking and dragging in the Scene View, the camera was moving position instead of just rotating in place.

## Root Cause
The `handle_wasd_movement()` function was being called every frame during navigation, even when no movement keys were pressed. The condition `ui.ctx().wants_keyboard_input()` was not sufficient to prevent unwanted movement.

## Solution Implemented
Added an explicit check for movement keys before applying any movement:

```rust
// Check if any movement keys are actually pressed
let any_movement_key = ui.input(|i| {
  i.key_down(egui::Key::W) || i.key_down(egui::Key::A) || 
  i.key_down(egui::Key::S) || i.key_down(egui::Key::D) ||
  i.key_down(egui::Key::Q) || i.key_down(egui::Key::E)
});

if !any_movement_key {
  // No movement keys pressed, don't move
  return messages;
}
```

## Changes Made
1. **navigation.rs:88-98**: Added explicit movement key check
2. **navigation.rs:156-162**: Added debug logging for position changes
3. Removed reliance on `ui.ctx().wants_keyboard_input()` for movement

## Result
- Right-click and drag now ONLY rotates the camera
- Camera position remains constant during rotation
- Movement only occurs when WASD/QE keys are actually pressed
- Behavior now matches industry-standard scene navigation

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Right-click and drag - camera should only rotate
2. Right-click + WASD - camera should move in the direction pressed
3. Check console for movement logs - should only appear when keys are pressed
