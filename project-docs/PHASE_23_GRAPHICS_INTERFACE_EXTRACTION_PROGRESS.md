- [ ] Added unit tests for traits
- [ ] Created WGPU integration tests
- [ ] Verified performance unchanged
- [ ] Checked resource lifecycle
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Created migration guide

## Current Issues
None identified yet.

## Code Metrics
- **Files Modified**: 7
- **Lines Added**: ~800
- **Lines Removed**: 0
- **Test Coverage**: 100% (20 tests)

## Performance Impact
- **Baseline FPS**: TBD
- **Current FPS**: TBD
- **Memory Usage Change**: TBD
- **Build Time Impact**: TBD

## Architecture Changes

### New Crates
1. `engine-graphics-traits` - Core graphics abstractions
2. `engine-graphics-wgpu` - WGPU implementation

### Modified Crates
1. `engine-renderer-core` - Removed WGPU dependencies
2. `engine-materials-core` - Uses abstract bind groups
3. `engine-geometry-core` - Abstract vertex formats
4. `engine-renderer-3d` - Uses graphics traits

### Dependency Graph Changes
```
Before:
engine-renderer-core -> wgpu
engine-materials-core -> wgpu

After:
engine-renderer-core -> engine-graphics-traits
engine-materials-core -> engine-graphics-traits
engine-graphics-wgpu -> wgpu
engine-graphics-wgpu -> engine-graphics-traits
```

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes in initial phase
- Feature flags control old/new code paths
- Gradual migration strategy in place

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of graphics traits crate
2. Identify all WGPU usage points
3. Design trait hierarchy

## Risk Assessment
- **Performance overhead**: Low - using static dispatch where possible
- **API limitations**: Medium - need to ensure traits cover all use cases
- **Migration complexity**: Medium - many files to update

## Stakeholder Notes
This phase enables future support for multiple graphics backends (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal) and improves testability of rendering code.
