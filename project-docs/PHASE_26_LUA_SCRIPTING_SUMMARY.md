# Phase 26: Lua Scripting Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 26 introduces Lua scripting support to the Longhorn game engine, providing a lightweight and performant scripting solution for game logic and behaviors.

## Key Accomplishments (Week 1)

### 1. Foundation Setup ✅
- Integrated mlua v0.10 with vendored Lua 5.4
- Created `LuaScriptEngine` implementing the `ScriptRuntime` trait
- Established safe Lua/Rust interop patterns

### 2. Core API Bindings ✅
- **Math Library**: Vector operations (vec3 with add method)
- **Time System**: Delta time and total time tracking
- **Input System**: Key mapping and input query functions
- **Debug System**: Logging with multiple levels
- **Event System**: Subscribe/emit pattern for Lua scripts
- **Asset System**: Placeholders for loading resources

### 3. Architecture Design ✅
- Modular structure under `engine-scripting/src/lua/`
- Clear separation of concerns (engine, bindings, ecs, events, assets)
- Trait-based runtime system supporting multiple scripting languages

### 4. Testing & Examples ✅
- Created comprehensive integration tests
- Developed 3 example scripts:
  - `player_controller.lua` - Movement and input handling
  - `enemy_ai.lua` - State machine AI behavior
  - `game_manager.lua` - Game state and entity spawning

## Technical Highlights

### Performance
- Minimal overhead with 245KB Lua runtime
- Vendored build avoids system dependencies
- Efficient FFI using mlua's safe abstractions

### API Design
```lua
-- Clean, intuitive API for game developers
local pos = engine.math.vec3(10, 0, 5)
engine.debug.log("info", "Player at: " .. tostring(pos))

function update(dt)
    -- Called every frame with delta time
end
```

### Safety
- Sandboxed Lua environment (limited stdlib)
- Safe error handling with Rust Result types
- Proper lifetime management for cross-language calls

## Current Limitations
1. ECS integration is stubbed - needs real component marshaling
2. No hot-reload implementation yet
3. Event system not connected to engine dispatcher
4. Limited to basic types for now

## Next Steps
1. Week 2: Complete ECS integration with component registration
2. Week 2-3: Implement hot-reload with file watching
3. Week 3: Full engine API bindings (rendering, physics, audio)
4. Week 4: Editor integration and debugging support

## Code Quality
- All tests passing (6/6 integration tests)
- Clean compilation with minimal warnings
- Well-documented example scripts
- Modular, extensible architecture

## Impact
This implementation provides Longhorn with a modern scripting solution that:
- Reduces barrier to entry for game developers
- Enables rapid iteration without recompilation
- Maintains high performance for real-time games
- Supports future visual scripting tools

The foundation laid in Week 1 sets up the project for successful completion within the 4-week timeline.
