# Phase 17: Professional Camera System Implementation

## Overview
Implement a professional, accurate, and functional camera system for the Longhorn Game Engine that supports multiple camera types, proper matrix calculations, and efficient frustum culling.

## Duration
Estimated: 2-3 weeks (10-15 working days)

## Goals
1. Create a robust camera system with proper view/projection matrix calculations
2. Implement multiple camera types (FPS, third-person, orthographic, cinematic)
3. Add frustum culling for performance optimization
4. Integrate smoothly with the existing ECS and renderer
5. Support editor camera and game cameras separately

**Deliverables**:
- Updated `engine-camera-core` with proper matrix math
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Documentation of coordinate system conventions

### Phase 17.2: Camera Component System (2 days)
**Objective**: Design flexible camera components for ECS integration

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design camera component hierarchy (CameraBase, PerspectiveCamera, OrthographicCamera)

- ECS integration tests

### Phase 17.3: Camera Controllers - Simplified (1 day)
**Objective**: Implement FPS camera controller as foundation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create CameraController trait/interface
- [ ] Implement FPS controller (mouse look + WASD)
- [ ] Add smooth camera movements
- [ ] Implement basic constraints (pitch limits)

**Deliverables**:
- CameraController trait
- FPS controller implementation
- Basic smoothing support

**Note**: Other camera types (orbit, RTS) moved to future phases

### Phase 17.4: Frustum Culling System (2 days)
**Objective**: Optimize rendering with frustum culling

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Extract frustum planes from view-projection matrix
- [ ] Implement sphere-frustum intersection tests
- [ ] Implement AABB-frustum intersection tests
- [ ] Add spatial partitioning integration (octree/quadtree ready)
- [ ] Create culling statistics/debug visualization
- [ ] Optimize with SIMD operations

**Deliverables**:
- Frustum culling system in `engine-renderer-3d`
- Performance benchmarks
- Debug visualization tools

### Phase 17.5: Editor Camera Integration (2 days)
**Objective**: Separate editor and game cameras properly

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Refactor current editor camera to use new system
- [ ] Add camera gizmos in scene view
- [ ] Implement camera preview windows
- [ ] Add camera frustum visualization
- [ ] Create camera manipulation tools
- [ ] Add focus/frame selected object functionality

**Deliverables**:
- Updated editor with new camera system
- Camera visualization tools
- Improved scene navigation

### Phase 17.6: Advanced Features (2 days)
**Objective**: Add professional camera features

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement camera shake system
- [ ] Add depth of field parameters
- [ ] Create camera animation/path system
- [ ] Implement split-screen support
- [ ] Add post-processing integration hooks
- [ ] Create camera state save/load system

**Deliverables**:
- Advanced camera features
- Camera preset system
- Animation support

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Changes
1. **Separate Concerns**:
   - Camera data (position, rotation, projection) in components
   - Camera control logic in controllers
   - View/projection matrix calculation in camera system
   - Frustum culling in renderer

2. **New Interfaces**:
   ```rust
   trait CameraController {
       fn update(&mut self, input: &Input, delta_time: f32);
       fn get_transform(&self) -> Transform;
   }
   
   trait Cullable {
       fn get_bounding_volume(&self) -> BoundingVolume;
   }
   ```

3. **Matrix Pipeline**:
   - Model Matrix (from Transform)
   - View Matrix (from Camera position/rotation)
   - Projection Matrix (from Camera parameters)
   - MVP composition for shaders

### Performance Targets
- Frustum culling should reduce draw calls by 40-60%
- Camera updates under 0.5ms per frame
- Support for 10+ simultaneous cameras
- Zero allocation camera updates

### Best Practices (from research)
1. **Unity-style Component Architecture**: Cameras as components attached to entities
2. **Unreal-style Performance**: Efficient culling and LOD support
3. **Matrix Independence**: Frustum should only need VP matrix, not camera implementation
4. **Spatial Optimization**: Prepare for octree/quadtree integration
5. **Debug Visualization**: Show frustums, culling stats, camera info

## Success Criteria
1. Accurate view/projection matrices matching industry standards
2. Multiple camera types working correctly
3. 40%+ performance improvement from frustum culling
4. Smooth camera controls in editor
5. Clean separation between editor and game cameras
6. All unit tests passing
7. No regression in existing functionality

## Dependencies
- Existing Transform component system
- Input system for camera controls
- Renderer for frustum culling integration
- ECS for camera components

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Coordinate System Confusion**: Document and test extensively
2. **Performance Regression**: Benchmark before and after
3. **Breaking Changes**: Maintain compatibility layer during transition
4. **Numerical Precision**: Use appropriate epsilon values for comparisons
