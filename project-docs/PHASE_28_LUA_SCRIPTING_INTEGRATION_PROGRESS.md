## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### ✅ Completed Decisions
1. **Research Phase**: Completed comprehensive research on game engine scripting patterns
2. **Lifecycle Pattern**: Adopted init/update/destroy pattern from Unity/Unreal/Godot
3. **ECS Integration**: Scripts as components with direct entity access  
4. **Hot Reload**: Integration with existing Phase 27 hot reload infrastructure
5. **Lua Library**: Using mlua for Rust-Lua interop
6. **Single Lua State**: One lua_State shared across all scripts for efficiency

### 🔄 Pending Decisions
1. **Error Handling Strategy**: Determine crash vs. disable behavior for script errors
2. **Performance Limits**: Set thresholds for script execution time limits
3. **API Surface**: Finalize which engine APIs to expose to Lua
4. **Script Format**: Decide on module vs. global function patterns
5. **Debugging Integration**: Choose debugging/profiling tools and integration
