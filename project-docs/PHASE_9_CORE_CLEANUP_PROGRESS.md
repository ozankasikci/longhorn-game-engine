# Phase 9: Core Folder Cleanup and Reorganization - Progress Tracker

## Phase Overview
Comprehensive cleanup and reorganization of the core folder structure to eliminate code duplication, improve separation of concerns, and establish proper 4-tier architecture boundaries.

## Research Complete ‚úÖ
- **Implementation Plan**: `PHASE_9_CORE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`

*Status: Complete*
- Documented 3 camera systems:
 - engine-camera-core: Advanced viewport, projection, culling features

 - engine-ecs-core: Camera, Camera2D ECS components
- Identified overlapping functionality and consolidation opportunities

#### Task 9.2.2: Merge Camera Systems ‚úÖ
*Status: Complete*

- Updated workspace dependencies and imports

#### Task 9.2.3: Update Camera Dependencies ‚úÖ
*Status: Complete*
- Removed camera.rs from engine-scene-core
- Updated lib.rs to remove camera module and exports
- Verified editor still compiles with unified camera system
- Camera consolidation phase complete

**Phase 9.2 Complete: Camera Consolidation** ‚úÖ
- All 3 camera systems unified into engine-camera-core
- Duplicates removed from engine-ecs-core and engine-scene-core 
- Editor functionality maintained

### Phase 9.3: Component Organization üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Create centralized component system and standardize Transform

#### Task 9.3.1: Create engine-components-core ‚è≥
*Status: In Progress*
*Estimated Time: 45 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:
- Create new `crates/core/engine-components-core/` directory
- Move components from `engine-ecs-core/src/components.rs`
- Include: Mesh, Material, Name, Visibility, Sprite, SpriteRenderer, Canvas
- Implement proper component traits for both ECS systems
- Add workspace dependency configuration

#### Task 9.3.2: Standardize Transform Component ‚è≥
*Status: Pending*
*Estimated Time: 30 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:
- Choose best Transform implementation from current duplicates
- Ensure compatibility with both ECS systems (Component + ComponentV2)
- Move Transform to engine-components-core
- Update all Transform references across codebase
- Verify scene navigation and object manipulation still works

#### Task 9.3.3: Update Component Dependencies ‚è≥
*Status: Pending*
*Estimated Time: 15 minutes*
**Implementation Plan**:
- Update engine-ecs-core to depend on engine-components-core
- Update editor and other consumers to import from engine-components-core
- Remove component definitions from entity core
- Verify all component functionality in editor

### Phase 9.4: Delete Unused Crates ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Objective**: Remove dead code and clean workspace

#### Task 9.4.1: Remove Unused Audio and Physics Crates ‚úÖ
*Status: Complete*
- Verified no references to engine-audio-core and engine-physics-core in actual code
- Deleted `crates/core/engine-audio-core/` directory 
- Deleted `crates/core/engine-physics-core/` directory
- Note: These can be recreated later when actually needed

#### Task 9.4.2: Clean Workspace Configuration ‚úÖ
*Status: Complete*
- Removed deleted crates from `Cargo.toml` workspace members
- Removed workspace dependency entries for deleted crates
- Updated engine-runtime to remove audio/physics dependencies
- Verified no remaining references to deleted crates
- Editor builds successfully after cleanup

## Progress Summary
