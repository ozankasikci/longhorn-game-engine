# Phase 5.1 Core Graphics Refactoring - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully completed the refactoring of the monolithic `engine-graphics-core` into 4 focused domain-specific core crates, addressing the user's concern that "graphics" was too generic.

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Core Crates

#### 1. `engine-renderer-core` ✅
- **Purpose**: Pure rendering abstractions and command patterns
- **Dependencies**: glam, serde, thiserror (zero implementation deps)
- **Key Components**:
  - Core `Renderer` trait with comprehensive interface
  - `RenderCommand` enum for command pattern rendering
  - `RenderQueue` with priority sorting (opaque, transparent, UI, debug)
  - `TextureDescriptor`, `BufferDescriptor` resource abstractions
  - Viewport and capability management

#### 2. `engine-geometry-core` ✅
- **Purpose**: Mesh data structures, vertex formats, and spatial operations
- **Dependencies**: glam (with bytemuck), serde, bytemuck
- **Key Components**:
  - Multiple `Vertex` types (standard, simple, skinned, colored)
  - Comprehensive `Mesh` system with validation
  - `BoundingBox` and `BoundingSphere` with intersection tests
  - Spatial operations and culling optimizations
  - Primitive mesh generators (cube, sphere, cylinder, plane)

#### 3. `engine-materials-core` ✅  
- **Purpose**: Material system and PBR properties
- **Dependencies**: engine-renderer-core, serde
- **Key Components**:
  - PBR `Material` system with metallic-roughness workflow
  - Comprehensive `Color` system with space conversions (sRGB, Linear, HSL)
  - `Shader` abstractions supporting WGSL, HLSL, GLSL, SPIR-V
  - Texture management through renderer-core re-exports
  - Alpha blending modes (Opaque, Mask, Blend)

#### 4. `engine-scene-core` ✅
- **Purpose**: Scene management, hierarchies, cameras, and lighting
- **Dependencies**: renderer-core, geometry-core, materials-core, glam, serde
- **Key Components**:
  - `SceneNode` hierarchy with parent-child relationships
  - `Transform` component with position, rotation, scale
  - `Camera` system with perspective/orthographic projections
  - `Light` system supporting directional, point, spot, and area lights
  - Scene management with loading/unloading capabilities

### Architecture Improvements

#### Domain-Driven Separation
- **Before**: Single monolithic `engine-graphics-core` 
- **After**: 4 focused crates with clear separation of concerns
- **Benefit**: More maintainable, testable, and extensible architecture

#### Dependency Flow (Tier 1: Core Abstractions)
```
engine-scene-core
├── engine-renderer-core (rendering abstractions)
├── engine-geometry-core (mesh and spatial data)  
└── engine-materials-core (materials and shaders)
    └── engine-renderer-core (texture handles)
```

#### Clean Abstractions
- Zero implementation dependencies in core crates
- Pure trait-based interfaces for dependency injection
- Handle-based resource management for loose coupling
- Comprehensive error handling with thiserror

### Technical Achievements

#### Compilation Success
- All 4 new core crates compile independently ✅
- Full workspace compilation successful ✅
- Proper dependency management in Cargo workspace ✅
- Fixed compilation issues (bytemuck features, Vec4Swizzles, serde_json)

#### Code Quality
- Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
- Extensive trait implementations for usability
- Performance-optimized data structures (Pod/Zeroable for GPU)
- Mobile-first design considerations

#### Integration Ready
- Workspace dependencies configured for all new crates
- Ready for implementation layer (Tier 2) integration
- Maintains compatibility with existing ECS v2 system
- Editor integration pathways established

## Next Steps

### Phase 5.2: Remove Old Graphics-Core
- Remove old `engine-graphics-core` crate
- Update existing crates to use new core dependencies
- Clean up workspace configuration

### Phase 5.3: Update Implementation Layer
- Update `engine-graphics` to use new core abstractions
- Implement WGPU-based renderers using renderer-core traits
- Integrate new material system with existing rendering

### Phase 5.4: Integration Testing
