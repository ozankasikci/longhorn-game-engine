## Code Metrics
- **Dependencies Removed**: 0
- **Traits Created**: 0
- **Files Modified**: 0
- **Test Coverage**: N/A

## Dependency Analysis

### Before Decoupling
```
engine-renderer-core dependencies:
- engine-ecs-core (direct)
- engine-component-traits (direct)
- engine-math-core (direct)
- engine-geometry-core (direct)
- engine-materials-core (direct)
```

### After Decoupling
```
engine-renderer-core dependencies:
- engine-math-core (direct)
- engine-geometry-core (direct)
- engine-materials-core (direct)
- No ECS dependency!
```

## Architecture Improvements

### New Abstractions
1. **Renderable Trait**: Abstraction for renderable entities
2. **TransformProvider**: Generic transform access
3. **RenderableQuery**: ECS-agnostic query interface
4. **SystemRegistry**: Service locator pattern

### Removed Couplings
1. Renderer → ECS component access
2. Physics → ECS entity references
3. Audio → ECS spatial queries
4. Camera → ECS view queries

## Performance Metrics
- **Baseline Render Time**: TBD ms
- **With Abstractions**: TBD ms
- **Overhead**: TBD%
- **Memory Impact**: TBD KB

## Testing Results
- **Unit Tests Added**: 0
- **Integration Tests**: 0
- **Mock Implementations**: 0
- **Coverage Improvement**: 0%

## Migration Status

### Phase 1: Abstractions Added
- [ ] Traits defined alongside existing code
- [ ] Adapters implemented
- [ ] No breaking changes

### Phase 2: Systems Updated
- [ ] Renderer migrated
- [ ] Physics migrated
- [ ] Audio migrated
- [ ] Camera migrated

### Phase 3: Cleanup
- [ ] Old dependencies removed
- [ ] Adapters finalized
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Benefits Realized
- **Testability**: Systems can be tested in isolation
- **Modularity**: Systems are pluggable
- **Flexibility**: Alternative implementations possible
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries established

## Next Steps
1. Begin coupling point analysis
2. Design initial trait abstractions
3. Create proof-of-concept implementation

## Risk Mitigation
- **Over-abstraction**: Keeping traits minimal
- **Performance**: Using generics for hot paths
- **Complexity**: Creating clear documentation

## Stakeholder Notes
This phase improves system modularity and enables independent testing of core systems. It also opens the door for alternative ECS implementations and embedded use cases.
