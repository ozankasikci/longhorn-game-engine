## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Separate MeshFilter and MeshRenderer components** - Following industry-standard proven pattern
2. **Handle-based resource system** - Meshes and materials are referenced by handles
3. **Procedural primitive generation** - Basic shapes generated at runtime
4. **Material independence** - Materials are separate resources that can be shared

## Current Architecture

```
GameObject (Entity)
├── Transform
├── MeshFilter (holds mesh reference)
├── MeshRenderer (rendering properties + materials)
└── Name

Resources
├── MeshLibrary
│  ├── Cube
│  ├── Sphere
│  └── ...
└── MaterialLibrary
  ├── Default
  ├── Unlit
  └── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. ~~Begin implementation with Phase 12.1~~ ✅ Complete
2. ~~Create new component structures~~ ✅ Complete
3. Begin Phase 12.2: Material System Foundation
4. Maintain backward compatibility during migration

## Implementation Details

### Phase 12.1 Completed Components

**MeshFilter Component**:
```rust
pub struct MeshFilter {
  pub mesh: ResourceHandle<MeshData>,
}
```

**MeshRenderer Component**:
```rust
pub struct MeshRenderer {
  pub materials: Vec<MaterialHandle>,
  pub cast_shadows: bool,
  pub receive_shadows: bool,
  pub layer_mask: u32,
  pub enabled: bool,
}
```

**Enhanced MeshData Structure**:
```rust
pub struct MeshData {
  pub vertices: Vec<Vertex>,
  pub indices: Vec<u32>,
  pub name: String,
  pub submeshes: Vec<SubMesh>,
  pub bounds: BoundingBox,
}
```

### Phase 12.1 Test Coverage

All components have comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Unit Tests** (`engine-components-3d`):
  - MeshFilter creation and functionality
  - MeshRenderer with single/multiple materials
  - Builder pattern for MeshRenderer
  - Component trait implementation
  - Serialization/deserialization

2. **Integration Tests** (`engine-ecs-core`):
  - MeshData creation and bounds calculation
  - Resource handle comparison
  - Memory usage calculations
  - Multiple submesh support
  - Resource trait implementation

## Notes

- Current system uses single `Mesh` component with `MeshType` enum
- Need to maintain compatibility during migration
- Focus on cube first, then expand to other primitives
- Material system needs to support both shared and instanced use cases
- MeshData now implements Resource trait for proper resource management
- Tests are written before implementation (TDD approach)
