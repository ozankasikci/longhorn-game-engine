# Grid Rendering Improvements Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Grid Sizing
- Grid now adapts based on camera height
- 4 levels of detail:
 - Close (< 10m): 1m spacing, 50m extent
 - Medium (10-50m): 5m spacing, 200m extent 
 - Far (50-200m): 10m spacing, 500m extent
 - Very far (> 200m): 50m spacing, 2000m extent

### 2. Line Clipping
- Implemented proper near-plane clipping
- Lines crossing the near plane are clipped at intersection
- Prevents entire lines from disappearing when partially behind camera

### 3. Distance-Based Fading
- Lines fade smoothly based on distance from camera
- Fade distance scales with camera height
- Uses quadratic ease-out curve for smooth transitions
- Axis lines remain more visible than grid lines

### 4. Improved Line Styling
- Major grid lines every 10 units
- Minor grid lines with reduced opacity
- X-axis in red, Z-axis in blue
- Dynamic opacity based on distance

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Visibility**: Grid no longer disappears unexpectedly
2. **Professional Appearance**: Smooth fading and transitions
3. **Better Performance**: Only renders visible lines with appropriate LOD
4. **Improved Usability**: Clear spatial reference at all viewing distances

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- `improved_grid.rs`: Core grid rendering logic
- Dynamic grid level selection
- Near-plane clipping algorithm
- Distance-based opacity calculation
- Screen-space bounds checking

### Algorithm Flow
1. Determine grid level based on camera height
2. Generate grid lines within appropriate extent
3. Transform to camera space and check visibility
4. Clip lines at near plane if necessary
5. Calculate opacity based on distance
6. Render with appropriate style

## Future Enhancements

1. **Shader-Based Rendering**: Move to GPU for better performance
2. **Configurable Settings**: User preferences for grid appearance
3. **Additional Grid Types**: Polar, hexagonal grids
4. **Snap-to-Grid**: Integration with object manipulation

## Testing Results

The improved grid system provides:
- Stable rendering without popping artifacts
- Smooth transitions between LOD levels
- Proper clipping at all camera angles
- Professional appearance matching modern engines standards
