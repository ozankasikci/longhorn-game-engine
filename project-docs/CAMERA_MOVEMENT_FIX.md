# Camera Movement Fix (WASD Navigation)

## Problem History
1. **Initial Issue**: WASD movement followed fixed world axes instead of camera look direction
2. **Second Issue**: After initial fix, movement included pitch in forward vector but user wanted Y-movement controlled separately
3. **Final Issue**: Movement direction would "mess up" when changing camera angle - movement didn't consistently follow look direction

## Root Cause
The movement transformation was using an incorrect matrix calculation. The camera basis vectors were not being calculated properly, leading to movement that didn't match the camera's orientation at various angles.

## Solution
Created a new fixed navigation calculation in `navigation_fixed.rs` that correctly calculates camera basis vectors:

```rust
// Camera basis vectors in world space
let camera_right_world = [cos_yaw, 0.0, -sin_yaw];
let camera_up_world = [sin_yaw * sin_pitch, cos_pitch, cos_yaw * sin_pitch]; 
let camera_forward_world = [sin_yaw * cos_pitch, -sin_pitch, cos_yaw * cos_pitch];

// Transform movement from camera space to world space
let world_x = cam_right * camera_right_world[0] + cam_up * camera_up_world[0] + cam_forward * camera_forward_world[0];
let world_y = cam_right * camera_right_world[1] + cam_up * camera_up_world[1] + cam_forward * camera_forward_world[1];
let world_z = cam_right * camera_right_world[2] + cam_up * camera_up_world[2] + cam_forward * camera_forward_world[2];
```

## Key Improvements
1. **Correct Basis Vectors**: Camera right, up, and forward vectors properly calculated in world space
2. **Consistent Transformation**: Movement transformation matches the renderer's view transformation
3. **Full 3D Movement**: Supports movement in all directions including pitch-based vertical movement

## Coordinate System
- At rotation [0,0,0], camera looks at +Z
- Yaw rotates around Y axis (positive yaw turns left)
- Pitch rotates around X axis (positive pitch looks up)
- Movement is transformed from camera space to world space

## Testing Results
Verified movement at various rotations:
- 0° yaw: Forward moves +Z ✓
- 90° yaw: Forward moves +X ✓
- -90° yaw: Forward moves -X ✓
- 180° yaw: Forward moves -Z ✓
- 45° yaw: Forward moves at 45° angle ✓
- With pitch: Forward includes vertical component ✓

## Current Status
Camera movement now correctly follows look direction at all angles, providing intuitive FPS-style controls with proper 3D movement.
