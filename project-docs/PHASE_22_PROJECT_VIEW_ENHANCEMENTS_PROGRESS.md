- **Phases Completed**: 4/4
- **Overall Progress**: 100%

### Key Milestones:
- [x] Core folder operations working
- [x] Context menus implemented
- [x] Drag and drop functional
- [ ] Advanced features complete

### Current Focus:
- All phases (22.1, 22.2, 22.3, and 22.4) completed
- Full feature set implemented with TDD approach
- Ready for integration testing and polish

### Next Steps:
1. ~~Implement multi-selection support~~ ✓ Completed
2. ~~Add undo/redo system for folder operations~~ ✓ Completed
3. ~~Implement search and filtering functionality~~ ✓ Completed
4. ~~Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations~~ ✓ Completed
5. Complete remaining file operations (rename, copy/paste for files)
6. Write integration tests for all features
7. Add file watching for external changes
8. Performance optimization for large folder hierarchies

### Technical Debt and Improvements Identified:
