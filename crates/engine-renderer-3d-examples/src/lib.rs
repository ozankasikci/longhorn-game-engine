//! Examples for the engine-renderer-3d crate
//!
//! This crate contains all the examples that were previously in the main renderer crate.
//! Moving them here reduces the main crate size by ~2,272 lines (32.4%).

// This crate is primarily for examples, so lib.rs is minimal.
// All functionality comes from the examples themselves.
