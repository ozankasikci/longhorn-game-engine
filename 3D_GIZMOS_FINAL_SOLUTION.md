# 3D Gizmos Final Solution

## Summary
The 3D gizmos are now fully functional with mouse interaction in the Longhorn game engine.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Reduced Gizmo Size
- **gizmo_3d.wgsl**: Changed scale factor from 2.0 to 0.5
- **gizmo_3d.rs**: Changed gizmo_size from 200.0 to 80.0
- Result: Gizmos are now a reasonable size in the editor

### 2. Enabled Mouse Interaction
- **mod.rs**: Connected the 3D gizmo input handler
- Added proper input handling that:
  - Performs hit testing when drag starts
  - Only handles navigation if gizmo didn't capture the input
  - Updates object transform when dragging gizmo axes

### 3. Fixed Hit Test Scale Calculation
- **gizmo_3d_input.rs**: Updated scale calculation to match shader
- Now properly calculates: `(gizmo_size / viewport_height) * distance * scale_factor`
- This ensures hit testing aligns with the visual gizmo size

## Current Status:
✅ 3D gizmos render with proper size
✅ Mouse hit testing works correctly
✅ Dragging axes updates object transform
✅ Input properly prioritized (gizmo input blocks navigation)

## How It Works:
1. When you click and drag in the scene view, the system first checks if you're hitting a gizmo axis
2. If a gizmo axis is hit, it captures the input and starts dragging
3. The drag creates a plane perpendicular to the camera that contains the axis
4. Mouse movement is projected onto this plane and then onto the axis direction
5. The object's transform is updated in real-time

## Technical Details:
- Red arrow = X axis
- Green arrow = Y axis  
- Blue arrow = Z axis
- Hit threshold: 20 pixels from axis line
- Constant screen-space sizing regardless of distance
