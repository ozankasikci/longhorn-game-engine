# Unity-Style Gizmos Test Summary

## Test Implementation
I've created comprehensive tests for the Unity-style gizmos in:
`crates/application/engine-editor-egui/src/panels/scene_view/unity_gizmo_tests.rs`

## Tests Included

### 1. Projection Tests
- **test_world_to_screen_projection**: Verifies 3D to 2D coordinate transformation
  - Tests origin projection to screen center
  - Tests off-center point projection
  - Tests culling of points behind camera

### 2. Hit Detection Tests
- **test_hit_detection_x_axis**: Tests mouse clicks on X axis (red)
- **test_hit_detection_y_axis**: Tests mouse clicks on Y axis (green)  
- **test_hit_detection_z_axis**: Tests mouse clicks on Z axis (blue)
  - Each test verifies both hits and misses with proper thresholds

### 3. Drag Plane Tests
- **test_drag_plane_selection_for_x_axis**: Ensures X-axis drag plane is perpendicular to X
- **test_drag_plane_selection_for_y_axis**: Ensures Y-axis drag plane is perpendicular to Y
- **test_drag_plane_selection_for_z_axis**: Ensures Z-axis drag plane is perpendicular to Z
  - Tests the Unity-style approach of creating planes that face the camera while constraining movement

### 4. Math Tests
- **test_ray_plane_intersection**: Tests ray-plane intersection calculations
  - Tests successful intersection
  - Tests parallel ray (no intersection)
  - Tests ray pointing away (no intersection)
- **test_point_to_line_distance**: Tests distance calculation for hit detection
  - Tests perpendicular distance
  - Tests point on line (distance = 0)
  - Tests point past line end

### 5. Behavior Tests
- **test_screen_space_scale_calculation**: Verifies gizmos maintain constant screen size
- **test_entity_change_detection**: Ensures gizmo state updates when selection changes
- **test_drag_mechanics**: Tests drag initialization and state setup

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Using the test script
```bash
cd /Users/ozan/Projects/longhorn-game-engine
chmod +x test_unity_gizmos.sh
./test_unity_gizmos.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct cargo commands
```bash
# Build first
cargo build --package engine-editor-egui

# Run tests
cargo test --package engine-editor-egui unity_gizmo_tests -- --nocapture
```

### Option 3: Run all editor tests
```bash
cargo test --package engine-editor-egui
```

## Expected Results
All 12 tests should pass, verifying:
- ✅ 3D projection math is correct
- ✅ Hit detection works for all axes
- ✅ Drag planes are calculated correctly
- ✅ Ray-plane intersection works
- ✅ Gizmos scale properly with distance
- ✅ Entity changes are tracked

## Debug Output
The tests include debug output (visible with `--nocapture`) showing:
- Projection calculations
- Drag plane normals
- Hit test results

## Coverage
The tests cover the core functionality of the Unity-style gizmos:
1. **Visual rendering**: World-to-screen projection
2. **Input handling**: Hit detection and drag mechanics
3. **3D constraints**: Drag plane calculations
4. **State management**: Entity change tracking

## Notes
- Tests use mock view/projection matrices simulating a camera at (0,0,5) looking at origin
- Hit detection threshold is set to 10 pixels (matching the implementation)
- Tests verify the Unity-style approach of camera-facing drag planes
