# Longhorn Game Engine Editor Architecture

## Overview

The Longhorn Game Engine editor has been modularized into multiple crates to improve compilation times, code organization, and maintainability. This document describes the architecture after Phase 19 restructuring.

## Crate Structure

### Before Modularization
- `engine-editor-egui`: 7,328 lines in a single monolithic crate

### After Modularization

#### 1. `engine-editor-scene-view` (~2,000 lines)
**Purpose**: 3D scene rendering and interaction
- Scene view panel implementation
- 3D navigation and camera controls
- Gizmo input handling
- Integration with the 3D renderer

**Key Components**:
- `SceneView`: Main scene view panel
- `SceneNavigation`: Camera and navigation state
- `SceneRenderer`: 3D rendering integration
- `GizmoInput`: 3D gizmo interaction

#### 2. `engine-editor-panels` (1,177 lines)
**Purpose**: All editor panels except scene view
- Inspector panel (component editing)
- Hierarchy panel (scene tree)
- Console panel (logging)
- Project panel (asset browser)
- Game view panel (game camera view)

**Key Components**:
- `InspectorPanel`: Component property editing
- `HierarchyPanel`: Scene object tree view
- `ConsolePanel`: Log message display
- `ProjectPanel`: Asset browsing
- `GameViewPanel`: Game camera rendering

#### 3. `engine-editor-ui` (~800 lines)
**Purpose**: Reusable UI components and styling
- Toolbar implementation
- Menu bar system
- Settings dialog
- Tab viewer for docking
- Longhorn-style theming

**Key Components**:
- `Toolbar`: Play controls and tool selection
- `MenuBar`: File, Edit, View menus
- `SettingsDialog`: Editor preferences
- `EditorTabViewer`: Docking tab management
- Styling functions and theme definitions

#### 4. `engine-editor-assets` (~400 lines)
**Purpose**: Asset management system
- Texture asset handling
- Project asset organization
- Asset loading interfaces
- Asset caching with LRU eviction

**Key Components**:
- `TextureManager`: Texture asset registry
- `AssetLoader`: Asset loading trait
- `AssetCache`: LRU cache implementation
- `ProjectAsset`: File/folder representation

#### 5. `engine-editor-framework` (~600 lines)
**Purpose**: Core framework and state management
- Editor state management
- Play mode coordination
- World setup utilities
- Console message system

**Key Components**:
- `EditorState`: Scene object management
- `EditorCoordinator`: Play state transitions
- `PlayStateManager`: Timing and state
- World setup functions

#### 6. `engine-editor-egui` (~500 lines)
**Purpose**: Main application entry point
- Integrates all editor crates
- Main window and docking setup
- Top-level event handling
- Re-exports from other crates

## Dependency Graph

```
engine-editor-egui (main app)
    ├── engine-editor-framework
    │   ├── engine-editor-assets
    │   └── engine-editor-scene-view
    ├── engine-editor-assets
    ├── engine-editor-ui
    │   └── engine-editor-scene-view
    ├── engine-editor-panels
    │   ├── engine-editor-assets
    │   └── engine-editor-scene-view
    └── engine-editor-scene-view
```

No circular dependencies exist in this structure.

## Benefits of Modularization

### 1. Compilation Performance
- **Parallel Compilation**: Independent crates compile in parallel
- **Incremental Compilation**: Changes to one crate don't require recompiling others
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Smaller compilation units

### 2. Code Organization
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each crate has a specific purpose
- **Better Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details are hidden
- **Easier Testing**: Crates can be tested independently

### 3. Maintainability
- **Smaller Files**: Easier to navigate and understand
- **Focused Responsibility**: Each crate handles one aspect
- **Reusability**: Crates can be used in different contexts

## Inter-Crate Communication

### Shared Types
- `PlayState`: Defined in `engine-editor-scene-view`, used everywhere
- `ConsoleMessage`: Defined in `engine-editor-framework`
- `ProjectAsset`: Defined in `engine-editor-assets`
- `PanelType`: Defined in `engine-editor-ui`

### Trait-Based Integration
- `EditorApp`: Trait for panel rendering (in `engine-editor-ui`)
- `GizmoSystem`: Trait for gizmo interaction (multiple implementations)
- `AssetLoader`: Trait for asset loading (in `engine-editor-assets`)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Each crate has its own unit tests for internal functionality.

### Integration Tests
- `editor_panels_extraction_test.rs`: Verifies panel extraction
- `asset_management_extraction_test.rs`: Verifies asset system
- `editor_framework_extraction_test.rs`: Verifies framework
- `editor_integration_test.rs`: Tests inter-crate communication
- `end_to_end_test.rs`: Tests complete workflows

### Performance Benchmarks
- `compilation_benchmark.rs`: Documents compilation improvements

## Future Improvements

1. **Further Modularization**
   - Extract settings into `engine-editor-settings`
   - Create `engine-editor-commands` for undo/redo

2. **Plugin System**
   - Use the modular structure for plugin support
   - Allow custom panels and tools

3. **Async Asset Loading**
   - Implement async loading in `engine-editor-assets`
   - Background asset processing

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Centralized error reporting
   - Error recovery mechanisms

## Migration Guide

For developers working with the editor:

1. **Imports**: Update imports to use specific crates
   ```rust
   // Before
   use crate::panels::InspectorPanel;
   
   // After
   use engine_editor_panels::InspectorPanel;
   ```

2. **Type Locations**: Common types have moved
   - `ConsoleMessage` → `engine_editor_framework`
   - `ProjectAsset` → `engine_editor_assets`
   - `PanelType` → `engine_editor_ui`

3. **Trait Implementations**: Some traits now require explicit imports
   ```rust
   use engine_editor_ui::GizmoSystem;
   ```

## Conclusion

The modularized editor architecture provides significant benefits in terms of compilation speed, code organization, and maintainability. The clear separation of concerns makes it easier to understand and modify the editor, while the trait-based integration ensures flexibility for future enhancements.
