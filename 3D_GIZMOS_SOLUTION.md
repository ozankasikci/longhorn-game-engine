# 3D Gizmos Solution

## Current Situation
- The 3D gizmo renderer exists but has issues with visibility and scale
- The 2D overlay gizmos work well for input but don't look 3D
- We need a working solution now

## Immediate Solution: Enhanced 2D Gizmos
Keep using the 2D overlay gizmos but enhance them to look and feel more 3D:

### 1. Add Depth-Based Rendering
```rust
// In unity_style_gizmos.rs
fn draw_gizmo() {
    // Calculate which axis is closest to camera
    let axis_depths = calculate_axis_depths(world_pos, view_matrix);
    
    // Sort axes by depth (furthest first)
    let sorted_axes = sort_by_depth(axes, axis_depths);
    
    // Draw in depth order
    for axis in sorted_axes {
        draw_axis_with_depth_fade(axis, depth);
    }
}
```

### 2. Add 3D Visual Cues
- **Perspective scaling**: Make parts of the gizmo smaller when further away
- **Depth fading**: Reduce opacity for parts behind the object
- **Shading**: Add gradient to simulate 3D lighting
- **Occlusion hints**: Dashed lines for occluded parts

### 3. Improve Hit Testing
- Use actual 3D geometry bounds for hit testing
- Account for perspective in hit areas
- Prioritize front-facing axes

## Long-term Solution: Fix 3D Gizmos
The 3D gizmo system needs these fixes:

### 1. Shader Issues
- The scale calculation is incorrect
- Need to pass FOV as a uniform
- Fix the axis rotation logic

### 2. Rendering Issues  
- Gizmos might be too small
- Depth testing needs tuning
- May need a separate render pass

### 3. Integration Issues
- Ensure gizmo transform is correct
- Verify camera matrices match
- Check viewport calculations

## Recommended Approach
1. **Use enhanced 2D gizmos now** - They work and can look good
2. **Fix 3D gizmos in parallel** - Take time to do it right
3. **Switch when ready** - 3D gizmos are better long-term

## Benefits of This Approach
- Get working gizmos immediately
- Learn what works well in 2D version
- Apply lessons to 3D implementation
- No rush to fix complex 3D issues
